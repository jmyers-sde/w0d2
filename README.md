first homework assignment for Flagship

I have made a couple of python files and have made changes to both of them on two different branches. The goal of this is to merge all the changes of all the files on both branches smoothly. And I have completed the task given to me.

Also the other two files that I was moving things around with git is on a different branch and if you are grding my work then look at the other branch in the repository.
